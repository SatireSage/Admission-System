Zach:
1. Try-throw-catch added but idk if it works *mem alloc
2. Make example errors and show that code catches them

Nick:
1. Make the threshold functions virtual (the threshold functions already made) and get rid of all the friend functions

Anyone:
1. Make a working menu for the project
2. Do the unit test cases (I have done most of em in line 419 to 531 in main.cpp)

Slides need to be done as well
