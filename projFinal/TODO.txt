Zach:
1. Make example errors and show that code catches them
   Project doc says: 
   "Create an error input for each of the above case, and demo to your TA that your code can handle all the above errors."

Nick:
1. Menu: Threshold menu (so we can use the damn thing now that i fixed it)
         Menu to do stuff with Reject List (i.e. basically sort them or smth idk but we gotta do more than just print afaik)
2. Non-default constructor works kinda but i made changes to UID so that we dont have a set function for it 
   That fact has fucked adding or deleting a new student royally so we need to fix
