1. Overall sorting the domestic and international students
2. Make threshold functions virtual and get rid of all the friend functions
3. Divide all the classes into different files
4. Make a working menu for the project
5. Do the unit test cases (I have done most of em in line 419 to 531 in main.cpp)
6. Try-throw-catch added but idk if it works
7. Make example errors and show that code catches them

If possible, get this completed a few days before the project is due so I can clean the code up.
Ideally, get it done by next week coz its not a lot.
